# Object-Detect
This was just script I made working on Implementing VisionAI into my camera so I could theroritcally talk to my cameras. I am using YOLOv8 (to try to make object detection software and see if it will work properly). This is mostly just expermintal so this just a little bit of the code to trial YOLOV8.
